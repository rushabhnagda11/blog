# Why?


I think blockchains as a technology is here to stay. It kind of feels like to me what personal computer might have felt like in the 70's and what the internet felt like in the 90's. There is a ton of skepticism (maybe not enough) but hey I'm here to ride the wave

# Why Solana?

Because ethereum gas fees suck and having read the bitcoin paper in 2017 which basically involves burning a piece of the amazon rain forest to find a nonce, I think PoH (Proof of History) is incredible and more scalable. Ethereum is planning to launch PoS (Proof of stake) sometime in 2022 and when what happens I'd probably become a solidity dev. But until then solana and rust it is

# What am I trying to build?

I'm try to build a simple PvP (player versus player) game. It's Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) on the blockchain. There's a team called YAWWWW that has build a PvE (player versus environment) [RPS game](https://app.yawww.io/rps). You play against a bot who plays their moves randomly. I'm trying to build one step ahead where you can essentially play with your friends

# Next steps?

I've spent about 2 weekends learning the basics of solana and rust in order to build this out. I think I'm at the stage where the smart contract is almost done. Post that I'll build out the frontend. I'll post more updates on this post once I'm done. Stay tuned!
